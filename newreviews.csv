4.0 out of 5 stars,"Read this review before you buy ... may save you a lot of trouble tomorrow
            ","Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to ""obsolete"" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their ""cheap iPhone"" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, got my Mac !!!!
            ","Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect product!
            ","I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24

Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Best Budget Friendly Macbook
            ","I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don‚Äôt keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows

I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way.

Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Seller selling faulty product.
            ","I purchased this product on 7th March, 2018. It was working well for the first three months. But after that my MacBook Air started acting up. Sudden shutdown and sudden restart started becoming common day by day. It became so common that recently I had to take it to three authorised service provider and all of three of them confirmed that it was due to liquid damage. The most surprising part is there is no way this could've been damaged due to liquid damage. Never have I used any liquid around it and even the moisture content in my room is pretty much normal. After this, I was left with the option to work with the MacBook Air as is OR I had to pay Rs. 45000 to replace the logic board. It is very shameful that this product didn't even last for half a year. This seller is selling faulty product and there is no way I can do anything about it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivery was excellent. I was using Dell laptop before this
            ","Delivery was excellent. I was using Dell laptop before this, being a lawyer I was extensively using M.S word and excel, after purchase for about few days it was not easy to understand the pages and numbers with the hectic work which we need to handle, however as the day progressed it was ease and helpful since I had invested in the apple eco-system. But still word and excel are widely used and I need to convert before sending it to my clients. Though their is a export option but still the exported docs file are not compatible fully with widows laptop, for instance if you are using the track change option the deleted sentence/mark up does to appear in the exported docs and still there are few other issues like this. Printers we use will not be compatible with the apple software and their updates in the beginning and we need to run around to print documents till the printer release the update. But there are many advantages of MacBook which includes battery back up + you can easily carry multi task + advantage if you have invested in apple eco system + light weight + easy to move + premium look + till now I haven't seen any slow or virus issue (used for 3 months) + apps advantage + advantage of iCloud (if you are using it) + good for eyes (but I need to keep 13 inch much closure compared to my earlier 15 inch dell laptop). I continue to enjoy this new product of mine....  hope this review helps you in understanding more about the product, ignore spell and grammar

Here i would only like to discuss a few points about which i couldn't  find much on the net or you tube.****The first being screen being only 720p i.e. hd and not being 1080p i.e. full hd.As its a 720p screen so u cannot except it be as good as a 1080p screen but its not very bad as stated on the net. From my personal use i did not find to be bad at all. If you are a normal user like me then the screen should not bother at all. Only those people whose work mainly depends on color accuracy can avoid it for others i feel it shouldn't be a problem. personally I am enjoying the screen.****The second point is that macbook air has only i5 fifth gen processor. But even after having a fairly old processor the machine works like a champ and it performs all the  everydya tasks in a snap. Its not at all laggy or slow because the software optimization is  superb .####### Final thoughtsFor a average user whose tasks on laptop includes web browsing, youtubing, using microsoft apps etc this  is an excellent  laptop under 55k.if you found this review helpful then please upvote it.cheers!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mac Air review
            ","I have received the MacBook on yesterday morning. This is my first mac and I have been waiting for it since the day of placing the order.Cloudtail seller:I have availed the limited time offer of around 10k amazon pay balance cash back and the whopping price around 55k. So ultimately the price came around to 45k.Pros:1. It‚Äôs Apple and as all of you are aware of Apple products build quality, it‚Äôs too compact and well designed with high quality aluminium body.2. SSD replaced the old shit HDD. Dude, it‚Äôs damn too fast.3. Great for beginner level coding. If you plan to start pro level coding or if you‚Äôre a full time coder, go for Pro. Otherwise it‚Äôs perfect for the starting time.4. If you have an iPhone and your iPhone is connected to wifi, you can receive your call on mac itself. Great isn‚Äôt it?5. The trackpad is more than awesome. If you haven‚Äôt used a mac before, you will be mesmerized.Cons:The storage is 128 gigs. Out of 128, you can use 100 gigs only, the rest is used by the OS and preinstalled softwares.- to overcome this shortage don‚Äôt upgrade to 256 or 512 gigs, you‚Äôll bankrupt yourself unless you‚Äôre the owner of RBI(pun intended). Just install software‚Äôs in macintosh drive and use SD card or iCloud for the additional videos or images or docs.Overall it‚Äôs a great laptop in this range.Hope it helps.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"MacBook Air with low resolution display, still value for money
            ","Having used this MacBook Air for almost one week, I wish to say this is a value for money(I paid INR 57,000) for those who are wanting for a MacBook for general use. The highlights are its compact size, above average computing performance, longer battery backup. The drawback is a significantly low on display resolution. I was sadly disappointed knowing this after product was delivered. Having used a MacBook Pro for more than 2 years with a higher resolution display, I'm not able to digest using a below average resolution laptop. If the display resolution is one of your three major requirements of a laptop go for a MacBook Pro or another brand.

So let me tell you Amazon is completely trustworthy site, i got my product, a brand new one, no refurbished piece, and delivery is excellent. Even i was hesitating before putting this much amount of money for a prepaid order online, but believe me its completely safe.  About the product:---  This mac runs so smooth that you can run android studio with terminal , emulator and many other apps at the same time. The smooth running is because of its SSD and 8gb RAM.It has some heating issue but you can ignore them. So for a normal guy go for it without thinking twice.

            ","I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU -  Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.[...]! Thanks

5.0 out of 5 stars,"EXACTLY THE THING I WAS SEARCHING FOR.
            ","You always become cautious and careful while buying an item which falls in stretched budget and when your expectations are too high. It happened to me when I was planning to buy a laptop. Before this purchase, I went through many web pages, amazon and flipkart reviews and many others. I was maintaining a wish list for long but was not able to come on any conclusion. And of course, Macbook Air was on top of my wishlist and on amazon top sellers list. But I had few concerns.Display - Recently, one of my friend bought a Lenovo 320E Laptop and I experienced its screen. That was not full HD. That experience was so bitter that I was hesitating to buy any Non FHD laptop. And almost everyone was criticizing the display quality of Macbook Air. But I got to know, only after the purchase that the display is not poor for me anyway. Display is very good while working with all apps provided you know customisation in Mac like Zooming and all. Yeah‚Ä¶ viewing angles are not good.Feeling ‚Äì When I press keyboard, move my fingers on touchpad, carry it in my office, open and close lid, touch surface, I always feel awesome. I haven‚Äôt felt such with any machine; Never.Apple Support ‚Äì Amazing. Serial no of my product was not correct on the invoice. So, I was facing difficulties in registering my device on Apple site for warranty and support. I lodged a request to Apple and they called at scheduled time. The conversation was so very touchy and helpful. That day I realised why Apple is dominating this sector.Sound ‚Äì No complaint at all. Perhaps, some music lovers can find any.Verdict ‚Äì I am not a techie, but I suggest, If you want to buy a laptop only for watching movies, pictures editing, gaming etc, don‚Äôt buy it. And, if you are switching from window and don‚Äôt want to WASTE time in learning of operating a new OS, in juggling with somewhat new keyboard shortcuts, DO NOT BUY it. You can become frustrated while operating an all new OS for you. You can find some compatibility issues also like non availbility of optical drive, no support for Chinese accessories and all. If you don‚Äôt use cloud space for storage, you also may face difficulty with data storing as it is having only 128 GB SSD.If you can ignore above, then this is for you. Around 50K, you will not find any machine like this. Buy it because IT JUST WORKS.

It‚Äôs good that amazon wants to retain a huge customer back up, but the benefits of sale should be given correctly.I have been a windows user since the past 12 years and I was very skeptic about moving to Mac OS, though I‚Äôm an iPad and an iPhone user, and I know how good products apple gives.The specs, after all it‚Äôs 5th gen and the low storage was the concern and a complete change of dynamic in the OS as well.But as I‚Äôm writing today, I would want to say that I‚Äôm more than happy in using Mac.Though only 5th gen, but the hardware software compatibility that apple provides, undoubtedly is the best, and is visible in every sense. All of my devices are now integrated in a complete manner and the Mac OS is so snappy, that there‚Äôs not even a blink of doubt if I made the correct decision or not .Yes, they do not provide MS office, but you can look through YouTube and find many links who would give you MS office 2016 for free.Pros:- Exceptionally light weight- No noise at all, because of ssd- Ssd one of the major advantages as the boot time is only 2-3 seconds.- Exceptional battery- Ambient light sensors- The best track pad among any of the premium laptops in smoothness as well as the tonnes of gestures provided by the OS- MagSafe charger allowing it to charge in less than 2 hours, and a great standby batteryCons:- For people who are really interested in watching movies and storing them, an issue, box of the limited SSD storage.- screen not full hd, maybe an issue to people who really care about the same- price, but when offers are there, definitely go for it

Till date it is working and is very durable, even after very rough usage.Albeit, I was looking for an upgrade of RAM and processor, and I was awed by the new macbook pro 2017, with all its magic and tricks, somethings which kept me away from a impulse buy was that it lacked USB ports, Magsafe adapter, SD card slot.These 3 things were available on Macbook Air, and hence I was wavering between MBP & MBA, untill the Amazon sale happened, I was a bit late by the time I ordered the MBA, the actual deal price was at 44,999. But When I ordered it was at 49,999. I still thought it was a decent price, as comparing its $820 pricing in US market. So I am a happy customer.Now about the product:MBA is a super fast, light weight, spec wise awesome laptop, but it is structurally thin and gives a flimsy feeling that I've never felt with other apple products. Apart from that it works like a charm, you can't game on it. But can almost do everything else on it. The battery backup is a boon.If you're thinking between MBP and MBA, I would recommend go for MBP, although it is expensive and has a few setback. Mainly because of the build. And by no means does this mean, MBA is cheap or having bad quality, I mean it is structurally not as good as MBP.Pros:+ Battery+ Light weight+ Comparatively cheaper+ Its Apple, MacOS....etc, etc..Cons:- Non Retina- Flimsy- Low storage (128GB - Usable 100 GB only, it gets filled damn fast)- Comparatively lower processing power

1.0 out of 5 stars,"A RISKY BET AND NOW I REGRET WHY I SAW THE 5 Stars reviews. I‚Äôve got my lesson for life...
            ","To begin with I have to say I have MacBook Air 13 inch which is dead now. Why I mention a risky bet because if you‚Äôre not in warranty you‚Äôre gone if something happens. I bought the machine for 65,000 and now since the motherboard is gone which costs around 50,000 and no proper service centres I‚Äôve to buy a new laptop.Apple with not help at all except some trouble shooting steps calling 0009001009009 and that‚Äôs it. Every time service centres will cost you around 1,700 for just opening the laptop (diagnostics drama) and make a false report so to become PREMIUM service centres in the apple service locator page.Not a bad machine though but if you‚Äôre not a sort of rich guy who can afford another one at any time and instead buying this for some hope of 2/3 years lasting please reconsider this.Now I‚Äôm forced to buy a windows laptop. I‚Äôve no option left as apple don‚Äôt have their self stores yet in India which will be in future but none now.Anyway don‚Äôt take this as I‚Äôm writing because of my anger for the problem. I‚Äôm just making an honest review. Anyhow to show off to the public you can buy apple MacBook with logo half eating apple is most welcome..I‚Äôm attaching pics of my Mac. It‚Äôs over 1 year and not a scratch yet. But service centre people will sign you a declaration that there are scratches even if there aren‚Äôt any........** Apple call centre executives will talk so nicely that you will feel like the best after sales service one will get but slowly slowly you will learn.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you‚Äôre confused between Windows or Mac?
            ","Hi folks!I have purchased this MacBook from Amazon itself, I am writing this review after using it for around 3months. Initially I was confused (like most of the persons) that should I buy MacBook or Windows laptop? After a long research I have come to the conclusion that MacBook is good for me, though both of them have their own pros and cons.Summey of points which I collected is here, posting it for the benefit of others, also mind it‚Äôs my perception and it mayn‚Äôt be always correct for all cases.1. For this price tag you have limited number of Windows laptop of good brand and similar configuration.2. This is very sleek and aesthetically appealing laptop as compared to most of other laptops.3. Battery backup is best possible as compared to others.4. Viruses are almost nil for Mac.5. Bluetooth connectivity is easy in Mac (my own experience)6. Audio quality is best (with or without headphones) as compared to others.7. Apple logo makes it appealing üòâ(however not related to functionality).Now here is why Windows is good1. It has more compatibility (like HDMI output, reading files etc)2. More softwares are available (cracked software works better, however we should not use them).3. Windows is comparatively easier to work with (my own perception).So finally, if your requirement is a machine which is more reliable, better battery, durable and sleek (works better in tours and journeys) go for MacBook.If you need to do experiments with laptop (like cracked games and software) and have no experience of Mac need more connectivity and free or cheaper software and hardware, go for Windows.Both are good in their own ways.

No doubt, this macbook Air stands first in this prize range (50k).First about the delivery, got this product delivered within 2 days and amazon transportation service was really very awesome. With required air bags and dual protection.About the product.Design : 9/10Aluminum body carved with perfection, sleek and very elegant look. The apple logo that glows adds cherry. Backlight keyboard is perfect for working in dark. Gesture controls in trackpad are awesome. There are about 10 geasture controls that help you work with just your fingers. The design only lacks in air ventillation. The alluminium body gets heated up when i render video edits on premier pro. For normal work, it works fine.Performance: 10/10Although its a 5th generation i5 processor, but this works far better than the 7th gen i5 processors in windows laptop. Compared intensive rendering task and this mackbook air is upto the expected mark. Thanks to the optimization, that apple always do. 8GB ram, intel HD6000 graphics is just perfect for regular work and even works fine for small scale coding and professional video editing tasks. This mackbook air boots up in around 3 seconds and sleeps in around 2sec.Battery: 10/10The best battry life i had ever experienced in any laptop. Works for around 13 hours in a single charge (continious internet surfing and online videos). Battry do gets exhausted when using professional software (adobe premier pro)(cpu intensive task).MacOS Sierra is definitely all you need. Preinstalled apps helps you to do all your school, college or office works in one place. No need to download or buy MS office. iMovies is just perfect to edit small scale videos.Storage: 9/10SSD 128 gb is superfast and really makes your work lightning fast, but you need to buy an additional external hard disk to store files and other stuffs.Magsafe2 charger is just awesome, no damage to the charging port and pin as it gets plugged in through magnetic force. No wear and tear around charging port. Also prevents accidental damage.Thunderbolt 2 post perfectly works fine with add on connector (aroung 500Rs) for HDMI streaming. 2 USB 3.0 Ports are good but it could have one one USB post.All around, This laptop is perfect for everyday use and small scale professional use
