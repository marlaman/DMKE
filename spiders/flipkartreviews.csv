8,Hated it!,"I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.[...]! ThanksREAD MORE",5

13,Fabulous!,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whether this would be helpful as I've heard macOS could be a bit restrictive.And so a month long study on whether it's good purchase began. I read and saw reviews, asked a few who used it and it was always more or less balanced reviews. The heart wanted this but brain wanted a Windows laptop. I know people can relate to this feeling. :DFinally I decided to go with this and got it for 58k during Flipkart's Big Shopping Days.I got the laptop within 2 days and there it was. Right from the packing to the initial usage is was screaming premium. I don't think any windows laptop could match the build quality of this laptop, an all aluminum build and rugged. The track pad is made of glass and the experience of using gestures to control tasks is almost magical.There is an ambient light sensor which adjust the brightness accordingly.The Magsafe 2 charger is light to carry when compared with the 'brick' of windows laptops and the magnet docking will put a grin on your face.Coming to the speakers. You won't need an additional speaker setup if you're using it in a medium size room. It gets super loud and is a stereo setup.The two USB ports are USB 3.0 and gives appreciable read and write speeds.The SSD is just quick on its shoes and gets everything done blazing fast and it pleasing to work with.The front camera is just too good to be true. When compared with Windows front cams, this hits the ball out of the park.While reading all reviews everyone was attacking on how shitty the screen was and if changed to different angles the colors would seem washed out or so. I have never felt anything wrong and coming from an old windows PC and having used a few HD screen laptops, I didn't feel this was bad at all. Sure the colors do look washed out if you change the screen angle, but really who watches a screen odd angles anyway?I have installed Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro and After effects in this machine. They load fast and works smoothly for light tasks. (Make sure to close other apps like chrome while using these)So to conclude, if you're trying to get your first laptop or coming from a base laptop. This is the best purchase you can ever make. If you've been using FHD screens or retina screens and coming down to this, it could be a put off. Performance wise this won't disappoint you in everyday tasks.And make sure to update to Mojave (because it has the beautiful dark theme) which makes it totally lit.READ MORE",5
14,Terrific,bought 2 years back....still amazingREAD MORE,5
15,Terrific purchase,"just awsm, go Nd buy this stuffREAD MORE",5
16,Good choice,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone screen.. this becomes very convenient... and if you have minor issues on your laptop you can get them solved through apple support, you dont have to go anywhere.. problem will be solved instantly and at your own place... and the battery runs literally for 10-12 hours if you are a mild user and dont play games and it gets chraged in matter of an hour... and my mom is very happy with the laptop too and she enjoys using siri.. And its so light and protable compared to my old laptop.. i feel like i was draging around a block of stone back then.. and the sound quality is very good and loud enough.. The viewing angles are not that great but i dont care about it much because we bought the laptop for mild use.. The cam is pretty good and you have good inbuilt photo editing apps and apps that are equivalent to Microsoft office, excle , word... oh and if you want to use a Microsoft os on this laptop you can do that too.. its compatible with both osand u can even prot your data from your old mac or Microsoft laptop on this one... and last but not the least when you start the mac and you have to choose which keyboard you want.. i chose a qwerty pad and it was a disaster so i would suggest you choose a british keyboard so it would match the actual keys printed on your laptop and avoid confusion.. Thats all.. if you read this i hope it was helpful..READ MORE",4

18,Just wow!,"I purchased my MacBook air from Flipkart at a great festive discount. This was the most inexpensive option available in the market at any of the shopping sites. I must say that I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The quality of laptop and the performance of the machine is brilliant. The best advise that I can give to anybody willing to purchase a laptop is to invest a little more and go for the best. MacBook Air is one of the best machines From the perspective of quality, display, weight of the machine, battery life, ease of usage and brand.READ MORE",5

22,Simply awesome,"this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps.I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't slow down the machine or workflow. along with android studio, emulator I had 5-6 chrome tabs opened.now about the battery, to check how many hours I can work continuously on a full charge, I charged it to 100 % and started writing codes in android studio (without emulator) with chrome opened up to 10 tabs. after 4 hours of continuous run, it still had 56% charge. Note: I also connects my phone to to debug via USB. so it will going to provide me around 7-8 hours of backup on android studio which is a lot for a developer.Display is also looks good, I mean you can see things very clearly even with a the small font size. but viewing angles are not that much great but who cares 😁.so if you want a Mac for android studio this is still a good choice. I just fall in love with it 😍I never felt that much smoothness on any other PC ever before. my ratingsperformance 4/5battery 5/5display 4/5looks 5/5 😍READ MORE",5
23,Very poor,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating.2. Not booting and showing black screen.3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on.READ MORE",1

25,Very poor,"This is 2nd time I am facing in your exchange orders. inspite of giving all description, got harresed at the time of delivery. I hope no body will give brand new piece in exchange and for simple 1no scratch mark discount amount was reduced by RS.3800/-.I have paid the full amount and didn't opt for exchange.From next time onwards I will not opt for any item against exchange becoz felt cheated. Also will think twice to place orders to Flipkart.Honestly very dissatisfied with the service I got today.......READ MORE",1

28,Useless product,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.READ MORE,1

31,Terrible,This laptop has crashed within less than 8 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed twice and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece.READ MORE,1
32,Simply awesome,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it.READ MORE",5
33,Value-for-money,"Its a beast that u can't judge without using it. I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops. And believe me you can BOAST about your battery amongst ur friends if they don't have this model with them may ot be Macbook or Macbook pro, none of the windows laptop stands anywhere infront of this little miniature beast in case of battery. You own the so called the world's best keyboard in laptop ever till date, u can forget about butterfly keys which gets 3 keyboard replacement guarantee for free...PS* For students and bussiness only, AutoCAD opens in just 10 -12 seconds, you can test it with windows, no one can compete...NOTE : Not for gamers...READ MORE",4

36,Just wow!,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor.also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :)and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review...thanks for making such good product, apple.READ MORE",5
37,Terrific,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.READ MORE,5
